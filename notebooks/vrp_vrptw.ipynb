    "The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a combinatorial optimization problem in the area of logistics that aims to find a cheapest set of routes for a given fleet of vehicles such that all customers are served within their time windows and the vehicle capacity is never exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is formally defined as follows.\n",
    "We are given\n",
    "* a depot 0 where all vehicles are located in the beginning,\n",
    "* a set of customers $C = \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$,\n",
    "* a set of locations $L = \\{0\\} \\cup C$,\n",
    "* a demand $d_i \\ge 0$ for each customer $i \\in C$ (the depot has no demand, i.e., $d_0 = 0$),\n",
    "* a time window $[a_i,b_i]$ with $0 \\le a_i \\le b_i$ for each location $i \\in L$ (including the depot),\n",
    "* a service time $s_i \\ge 0$ for each customer $i \\in C$ (the depot has zero service time, i.e., $s_0 = 0$),\n",
    "* costs $c_{ij} \\ge 0$ for traveling from location $i$ to location $j$,\n",
    "* time $t_{ij} \\ge 0$ for traveling from location $i$ to location $j$,\n",
    "* and a homogeneous fleet $K=\\{1,\\ldots,|K|\\}$ of vehicles with load capacity $Q > 0$.\n",

    "* a route for each vehicle, i.e., an ordered sequence of customers\n",
    "* with minimal total routing costs,\n",
    "such that\n",
    "* each customer is visited exactly once,\n",
    "* the start times of the services have to be within the depot and customer time windows (potentially introducing waiting times between services),\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to model the VRPTW as compact MILP, without use of sophisticated column generation or cutting plane methods as needed in state-of-the-art approaches. \n",

    "The following modeling approach is used very frequently since it is quite intuitive and also used in many other optimization models. \n",

    "We introduce variables $y_i \\in [0,Q]$ for each location $i \\in L$ to denote the vehicle load after picking up the demand at $i$.\n",
    "Note that it does not matter whether we pick up demands or deliver them, as long as we stay consistent for all customers the set of feasible solutions in terms of routes stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following constraints model the fact that if connection $(i,j)$ is used then the vehicle load at $j$ is equal to the vehicle load at $i$ plus the demand at $j$. \n",
